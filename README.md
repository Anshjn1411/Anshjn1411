# 👋 Hi, I'm Ansh Jain

### 🧠 Android Developer | 🤖 AI Explorer | ⚙️ DevOps Learner | 🚀 Tech Innovator

I'm a self-driven Android developer from 🇮🇳 India, passionate about building real-world mobile solutions that solve meaningful problems. I specialize in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and I enjoy blending modern UI/UX with AI features to deliver intelligent, user-centric apps.

Lately, I’ve been exploring **DevOps** tools and practices to streamline development workflows and ensure seamless deployment. I believe in end-to-end ownership — from coding to deployment — and love working on projects that combine frontend, backend, AI, and automation.
